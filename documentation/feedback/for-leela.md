# questions:

1. is it intentional to connect to wallet automatically on arrival without permission?
1. is that handle minting an NFT or just writing into the moralis database?
1. how to embed that avatar selector into the profile NFT scene?
1. why do you ask the user for a handle to log in and then ask the user for another handle? can these be prefilled?
1. is it okay if we just limit it to 3 questions, and try to update it later? for the demo, maybe just:
   - handle (prefilled)
   - avatar image selector
   - profile type
   - what's your favorite bird?
   - why are you here?
1. can we delete the profile?
1. how does the metadata updating work?
